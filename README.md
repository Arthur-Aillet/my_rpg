![](./assets/img/readme/front.png)

MyRpg is the one of the last projects of the first year at Epitech Paris.
The goal is to create in 4 weeks with 4 people a technical demonstration of a video game. This game was one of the projects that motivated our team the most
so we invested lots of work. This investement has lead us to the best grade of the 2022 Epitech Paris promotion witch me are very proud of.
